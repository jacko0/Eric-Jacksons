Eric Jacksons Ltd has been trading in Waterlooville since 1928 and is the oldest established business in the area.

We remain proudly family-owned and committed to excellence in electrical contracting.

Since 1928, we have continually evolved to keep offering quality electrical services in the local area. 

Starting in 2026, our premises (that was once our home and shop) has been leased to another business.

Janet and Mike have also retired, but rest assured, nothing changes for you: same local family, same trusted quality, same expert team delivering a reliable service since 1928.
