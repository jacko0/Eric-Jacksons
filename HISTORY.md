OUR HISTORY

In 1928 Eric Jackson, his wife Marjorie and his parents decided to move from the centre of Portsmouth to live in the country. Behind Portsdown Hill they found the quiet country backwater of Waterlooville. There was a vacant property for sale in the town centre, in a row of houses known locally as 'Sidney Villas'. The family pooled their money and bought the house, moved in a few weeks later, and next on the list was for Eric to find a job.

At the time, the new invention of radio was beginning to spread, and a radio receiver needed a power source. Not many people had mains electricity in their homes, so to power a radio you needed an 'accumulator'. This is very similar to today's car battery, albeit 3 - 6 volts rather than 12. Like a battery, an accumulator needs to be recharged, so Eric came up with a business plan to collect, recharge and deliver them as a service.

As more and more people needed electricity in their homes, in addition to his new battery charging service, he offered a new service to connect properties to the new mains supply in the area. He also sold lamps and new batteries, but after a while the business grew and the house was not the ideal place to run an electrical business.

At some point Eric converted the lounge at 4 Sidney Villas into the shop of Eric Jacksons Ltd, but over the years the original structure of the building has been altered and extended. If you look carefully, you can still see the villa buildings from Eric Jacksons up to the takeaway.

All went well, and after the Second World War his son Michael was born and started working in the shop at the age of 15. He married Janet in 1969 and continued to develop Eric Jacksons Ltd. In 1987, Eric sadly passed away, leaving Michael and Janet to steer the business through some difficult economic times.
Michael's youngest son Peter joined Eric Jacksons in 2001, becoming the third generation of Jacksons to run the business. Together the family has seen through another economic recession and is now looking to the future, providing high quality electrical services to the area.

Eric Jacksons Ltd is now the oldest surviving retailer in Waterlooville, still operating from the original premises which Eric bought back in 1928.
In July 2020, Michael and Janet retired, leaving Peter and Jason to concentrate their expertise on electrical installations. The shop closed its doors for the last time was refurbished for use as Eric Jacksons Electrical Office.

Since 1928 everyone has been qualified to the latest standards, ensuring safety and high quality in all aspects of electrical testing and installation. In 1986 Eric Jacksons joined the National Electrical Inspection Council (NICEIC) and to this day this ensures that all aspects of electrical regulations are adhered to and quality checked annually by an inspecting engineer.
The team has collectively achieved over 20 different relevant qualifications including, City and Guilds, RSA and others.
