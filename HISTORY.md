OUR HISTORY

In 1928 Eric Jackson, his wife Marjorie, and his parents wanted to move out of central Portsmouth for a life in the country. Behind Portsdown Hill they found the quiet country backwater of Waterlooville. Back then, in the centre of town a row of houses known locally as “Sidney Villas” had a vacant property for sale. The family pooled their money and bought the house, a few weeks later they moved in, next on the list was for Eric to find a job.

At the time, the new invention of radio broadcasting was starting to become widespread and a radio receiver needed a power source. Not many people had mains electricity in the home, so to power a radio you needed an “accumulator”. This is very similar to a car battery from today, albeit 3 – 6 volts and not 12. Similarly to a battery, an accumulator needs to be recharged, so Eric came up with a business plan to collect, recharge and deliver these as a service.

As more and more people needed electricity in the home, in addition to his new accumulator recharging service, he offered a new service to connect properties to the new mains electrical supply in the area. He also sold lamps and new batteries, but after a while business was picking up and the house was not the ideal place to run an electrical business.

During the second World War a German fire bomb was dropped on the shop, it smashed through the roof and started a fire on the ground floor. Luckily, Eric was a local fireman and was able to put out the flames before the fire took hold.

At some point, Eric converted the lounge of No.4 Sidney Villas into the Eric Jacksons Ltd shop seen below.

However, over the years the original building structure has been modified and extended. But if you look carefully, you can still make out the villa buildings to the left of the shop (up to Victoria Road).

All was going well, and after World War 2, his son Michael was born and started working in the shop aged 15. In 1969 he married Janet and continued to grow Eric Jacksons Ltd. In 1987, Eric sadly passed away leaving Michael and Janet to steer the business through some tough economic times.

Michael’s youngest son Peter joined Eric Jacksons in 2001; he became the third generation of Jackson running the business. Together, the family has seen through another economic recession and are now looking to the future and providing quality electrical services to the area.

Eric Jacksons Ltd are now the oldest surviving retailer in Waterlooville, to this day it’s still operating from the original premises Eric bought way back in 1928.

Since Eric started, everyone is qualified to the latest standards ensuring safety and high quality throughout all aspects of electrical testing and installations.
The company joined the National Electrical Inspection Council (NIC EIC) in May 1986, and to this day this ensures all aspects of the electrical regulations are adhered to and quality checked yearly, by an inspecting engineer.

The team has achieved between them, over 20 assorted relevant qualifications including, City and Guilds, RSA and others.
